The challenge was to build a trivia game that shows one question at a time.  The user must select the correct answer before time runs out.  
If the player selects the correct answer, a congratulatory gif is randomly selected and displayed.
If the player selects an incorrect answer, a gif indicating that a wrong answer was selected is randomly chosen and displayed.
If time runs out with an answer selected, a gif indicating that time is up is randomly chosen and displayed.
The final screen shows the number of correct and incorrect answers.
